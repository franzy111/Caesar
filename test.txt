In general senior developers are wise and junior developers are clever but haven’t made the mistakes yet to be wise.
 The difference between junior developers and senior developers is experience, knowledge, and skill.

Experience is the difference. Once developers make a mistake,
they (hopefully) avoid it by not making the same mistake in the future.
This gives them the opportunity to make new mistakes and over time, developers know how to avoid more mistakes.

Mistakes in software development can be hard to see coming because the consequences and pain are far into the future.
Simple mistakes give quick feedback, you find it and fix it fast.

Trickier mistakes are something like hard coding a value and there doesn’t seem any downside initially.
Later, you need to do a complete release to change the value and you can pay for this decision many times.
